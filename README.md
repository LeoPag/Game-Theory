# Game-Theory-

This repo contains my solution for th assignments of the Game Theory course at ETH Zurich. They assignments are aimed at assessing the understanding of theretical concepts in the field of Game Theory but also require simulations in MatLab to be completed. The course cover the following topics: Nash Equilibria, Zero-Sum-Games, Potential Games, Convex Games, Auctions, Stackelberg Games, Repeated and Feedback Games, Dynamic Games.


# Homework 1
The first homework consist of three tasks:
 - Many Nash Equilibria: given two game matrices, we are asked to find all Nash Equilibria (pure and mixed) of the game.
 - Robust Tuning of an active dumper: we are asked to study a control problem by modelling it as a zero-sum game. We are asked to simulate the outcome of the game with MatLab simulations.
 - Trajectory planning game: in a simplified autonomous car driving scenario, we study the game two cars may end up playing when driving in opposite directions. By modelling the problem in game-theoretical fashion, we conclude that not all the Nash Equilibria minimize the Price of Stability.
